Multilabel Event Classifier for Power System Data

This repository contains the implementation of a multilabel classification model designed to identify and categorize power system events using real synchrophasor (PMU) measurements from 
the Brazilian Interconnected Power System (BIPS).

The model combines neural network techniques with customized evaluation metrics such as F1-Score (weighted), Hamming Loss, and Hamming Score, tailored to the characteristics of low-voltage
PMU data.
